# Weather-App
This is an app that I was taught by Tomi tutorial on Youtube.
I tryed my best to see if I could add a state to this code I did using state = input("Enter state") 
but it throws a 404 error code. I am still a beginner, so any type of help is welcome. I want to create my own programs with my own code added.
 Thnx in advance
